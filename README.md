    Hello! I'm passionate about integrating Catholic faith with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. Additionally, I work on projects that combine cutting-edge technology with practical applications in agriculture and cloud computing. My repositories reflect a dedication to creating resources that nurture both the mind and spirit, as well as advancing technological innovation.

### **Agricultural Technology Projects**

#### [Ag-Tech IoT Integration](#)

An innovative project that integrates IoT devices deployed in agricultural settings such as fields, tractors, silos, elevators, irrigation systems, and more. These devices communicate with Azure IoT services to enhance farm management and productivity.

**Key Features**:

- **IoT Deployment**: Sensors and devices installed in various agricultural assets to collect real-time data.
- **Azure IoT Hub**: Centralized communication between IoT devices and the cloud.
- **Data Storage Paths**:
  - **Hot Path**: Real-time data processing using Azure Stream Analytics for immediate insights.
  - **Cold Path**: Long-term data storage using Azure Data Lake for historical analysis.
- **Data Processing and Analytics**:
  - **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for on-demand data processing.
  - **Azure Machine Learning**: Predictive analytics for crop yield estimation and anomaly detection.
- **Decision Making**:
  - **Azure Cognitive Services**: Advanced analytics for image recognition (e.g., pest detection).
  - **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Unified experience for big data and data warehousing.
- **Operational Management**:
  - **Azure Logic Apps**: Automated workflows for routine tasks.
  - **Azure Monitor**: Monitoring and diagnostics for IoT devices and cloud services.
- **Remote Operations**:
  - **Azure Digital Twins**: Virtual models of physical environments for simulation.
  - **Azure IoT Central**: Centralized application platform for managing IoT devices.

**Additional Agricultural Applications**:

- **Livestock Monitoring**: Using IoT sensors to monitor animal health and behavior.
- **Soil and Crop Analysis**: Collecting data on soil moisture, nutrient levels, and crop growth.
- **Weather Station Integration**: Incorporating weather data to optimize planting and harvesting schedules.
- **Drone Surveillance**: Employing drones for field surveillance and data collection.

### **Azure Cloud Projects**

#### [Azure Stuff ](https://github.com/bonJoeV/azure-stuff) 

A collection of Just In Time solutions for Azure. I have a private and public repo for this. Occasionally a solution is updated published publicly here. 

#### [Azure Deployment Templates](#) *This went private in November 2021*

A collection of deployment templates for Azure resources, focusing on best practices for infrastructure as code. The templates include:

- **ARM Templates**: Declarative JSON templates for deploying Azure resources.
- **Bicep Modules**: Simplified syntax for ARM templates using the Bicep language.
- **Terraform Scripts**: Infrastructure provisioning across multiple cloud providers using Terraform.

#### [Azure Governance and Policy Management](#) *This went private in November 2021*
Examples and guidelines for implementing governance and policy management in Azure, including:

- **Azure Policy Definitions**: Creating and assigning custom policies for compliance and standardization.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Managing user permissions and resource access.
- **Azure Blueprints**: Automating the deployment of governed subscriptions and resource groups.
- **Azure Security Center**: Implementing security best practices and threat protection.

**Technologies Used**:

- **PowerShell**: Scripting for automation and management tasks.
- **Azure CLI**: Command-line tools for managing Azure resources.
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**: Framework for deploying and managing resources.
- **Bicep**: Domain-specific language for deploying Azure resources.
- **Terraform**: Open-source infrastructure as code software tool.
